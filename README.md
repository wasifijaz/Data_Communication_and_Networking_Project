# Data_Communication_and_Networking_Project
Description
Design and implement a group of networks (at least 10) connected with each other. Use “192.168.x.” (where x = your last part of enrollment number. E.g. in ‘01-132178-023’, “23” is the last part of the enrollment number’) as first three octets for serial port addresses (use 255.255.255.252 subnet mask). At least 2 networks must assign addresses dynamically to the connected computers. One network should have at least 3 VLANS which are connected to router using single port. These VLANS should be able to communicate with each other as well. Moreover, computers in all these networks must be able to reach few (at least 3) websites. At least 2 WLANs should be connected with these networks. A VOIP call should be carried out between users of two different networks. 

Deliverables:
* Labeled Diagram (Addresses, Networks, Names)
* Names of Devices and Protocols used. 
* Connected and working networks (Packet Tracer) 
* Detail Report
